### **Project Overview**

* **Elevator Pitch:** Our website, SlotChain, solves India's frustrating salon booking problem while making cryptocurrency a practical and simple part of daily life.

* **Description:**
    SlotChain is a full-stack web application that allows users to book appointments at local barbershops and salons online. Our platform addresses the common inefficiency of walk-in appointments by enabling users to find establishments via geolocation or city search, select a service, and book a specific time slotâ€”eliminating guesswork and long waits.

    A core feature is our dual payment system, which accepts both traditional credit/debit cards and cryptocurrency (primarily Hedera HBAR). To incentivize crypto adoption, users who pay with HBAR receive a collectible NFT, which is visible in their personal dashboard. The frontend is built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript for a clean user experience, backed by a secure authentication system using JWTs and a MongoDB database for storing all user and booking information.

### **Known Issues & Limitations**

* **Crypto Payments:** Direct integration with Hedera HBAR was challenging, so we currently use a third-party site to process crypto transactions.
* **NFT Minting:** As a result of the payment workaround, the NFT reward system is implemented as a demonstration to show how the NFTs will be stored and displayed in the user's dashboard.
* **Location Services:** We encountered issues with the Google API for finding nearby shops, so the platform currently uses a mock data set for demonstration purposes.
