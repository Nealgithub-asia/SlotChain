* Project title: Slotchain
* One liner (elevator pitch): Our website, SlotChain, solves India's frustrating salon booking problem while making cryptocurrency a practical and simple part of daily life.
* Description: We built SlotChain, a full-stack website that lets you book appointments at local barbershops and salons online. You can check it out live at slotchain.vercel.app.
Basically, our website lets you book salons by using your location or "search by city" feature to find personal care establishments near you.you just need to book a time, pick a service, a date, and an available time slot. No more guessing or waiting in line.
At the time of checkout, You can pay using cryptocurrency (preferably Hedera HBAR)., or credit/debit card.
Get NFT Rewards: You get a cool, collectible NFT for every booking you pay for with HBAR. You can see your whole collection right in your dashboard.
We put this all together using a bunch of cool tech. The frontend is built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript to make it look clean and work smoothly.
We have a full authentication system using JWTs so users can sign up and log in securely.
We used MongoDB to store all the user info, bookings, and station details.
